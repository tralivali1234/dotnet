## Networking

* [ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.servicepointmanager.securityprotocol?view=netframework-4.7) will default to a new value: SystemDefault which allows applications to use the underlying operating system TLS version selection defaults.
New [SslStream*AuthenticateAs*](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/System.Net.Security.SslStream?view=netframework-4.7) APIs allow applications to omit the SslProtocols parameter and use the system default.

* Enable [per-monitor scaling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171868(v=vs.110).aspx#wf47) in DPI mode [292303]

## Workflow

* Support for propagating an activity exception as-is instead of throwing a Null Reference Exception. For details refer to [Application compatibility changes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt800102(v=vs.110).aspx). [155469]
* Previously when trying to use Visual Studio to debug XAML-based workflows on a machine with FIPS enabled, one would encounter a NullReferenceException. This has been resolved. However, in order to take advantage of this change, you will need to add the following to the App.Config file for the workflow application:
```
<runtime>
<AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Activities.UseMD5ForWFDebugger=false" />
</runtime>
```
For details refer to [Application compatibility changes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt800102(v=vs.110).aspx). [193017]
* SqlWorkflowInstanceStore database now defines Primary Key columns, allowing transactional replication. [206271]

## WPF

* WPF now uses [PrintDocumentPackageTarget](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt800103(v=vs.110).aspx) instead of the deprecated XpsPrint API. [113979]
* Fixed crash in WPF when typing in text with specific language input  [121579]
* The escape sequences have been unescaped in the URLs while converting from XAML to RTF. [132397]
* Fixed crash in DocumentView when receiving input from IMEs. [133072]
* Fixed ribbon crash when Alt + accelerator key is pressed to display the submenu. [170982]
* Previously, large amounts of connects and disconnects of tablet/stylus devices could result in WPF losing all touch support except for promoted mouse messages.  This was due to a reference counting issue within WPF and its Windows side touch component (WISP).  This change, along with the associated WISP change available in RS2, fixes this situation allowing large numbers of connects and disconnects. [174153]
* Conversion of BaselineOffset property has been added while converting from XAML to RTF and vice versa. [181850]
* Modernize touch stack [197685]
* Fixed crashes in Combobox [208379]
* Added support for alternative delimiter characters in markup. [210368]
* Fixed textbox focus issues [215639]
* Fixed out of memory issues with custom textbox. [216018]
* In some scenarios, shutting down input for a stylus/touch device (program shutdown or device disconnection) could result in a deadlock.  This change alleviates that issue by fixing a timing problem with the WPF stylus/tablet initialization and shutdown code. [220285]
* In order to disable the WPF stylus/touch stack developers were previously using a private reflection mechanism.  This provides a new mechanism in the form of an AppContext switch.  Switch.System.Windows.Input.Stylus.DisableStylusAndTouchSupport set to true will fully disable the stylus/touch stack without requiring any private reflection or other workarounds. [221075]
* Inheritable properties propagate through a new link in the visual tree, including properties declared in a Style newly enabled by the link because a DynamicResource reference now resolves. [221837]
* [ImageSourceConverter.ConvertFromString](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt800102(v=vs.110).aspx) now throws the correct DirectoryNotFoundException instead of NullReferenceException if called with an invalid path (only on apps targeting .NET Framework 4.7 and above) [223209]
* Fixed IOException crashes arising from Cursor.LoadFromStream, that could happen on application start. [227517]
* Fixed a deadlock arising from re-entrant COM requests while waiting for the lock protecting WPF's weak-event component. [234423]
* Scroll tracing now supports scenarios involving multiple instances of an ItemsControl with the same name, that enter and leave the visual tree dynamically. [234612]
* Some ItemsControls allow null to appear in the ItemsSource.  If so, the automation for the control should allow null as well.   An app that works in a normal environment should not crash in when automation is present. [239479]
* Fixed an ArgumentException arising from bindings on a non-Visual element declared in a DataGrid cell template. [240237]
* Improved Grid algorithm usages to allocate space to columns declared with *-width. For details refer to [Application compatibility changes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt800102(v=vs.110).aspx). [245278]
* Fixed crash arising from displaying certain sequences of Unicode characters deemed (by the font and by DWrite) to have negative advance width. [252835]
* Fixed a crash arising when running two instances of a process that creates multiple large packages when using System.IO.Packaging. [259773]
* When an exception interrupts a PropertyChanged or CollectionChanged notification raised on a worker thread, other such notifications continue to be processed normally. [260469]
* Fixed D3DImage memory leak. [261139]
* Fixed crashes in DataGrid with column virtualization enabled scenario. [274127]
* Improved reliability of anchored scroll scenarios. [282666]
* Support for Async and AddJob scenarios in printing. [292567]
* The content of the selected item in a TabControl is visible to UI Automation, even after changing IsEnabled (or other properties) on the TabItems. [365337]
