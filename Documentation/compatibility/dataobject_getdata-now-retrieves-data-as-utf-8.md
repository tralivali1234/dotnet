## DataObject.GetData now retrieves data as UTF-8

### Scope
Edge

### Version Introduced
4.5.2

### Source Analyzer Status
Available

### Change Description

For apps that target the .NET Framework 4 or that run on the .NET Framework
4.5.1 or earlier versions, `DataObject.GetData` retrieves HTML-formatted data as
an ASCII string. As a result, non-ASCII characters (characters whose ASCII codes
are greater than 0x7F) are represented by two random characters.

For apps that target the .NET Framework 4.5 or later and run on the .NET
Framework 4.5.2, `DataObject.GetData` retrieves HTML-formatted data as UTF-8,
which represents characters greater than 0x7F correctly.

- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action

If you implemented a workaround for the encoding problem with HTML-formatted
strings (for example, by explicitly encoding the HTML string retrieved from the
Clipboard by passing it to
<xref:System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetString(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)?displayProperty=name>)
and you're retargeting your app from version 4 to 4.5, that workaround should be
removed.

If the old behavior is needed for some reason, the app can target the .NET Framework 4.0 to get that behavior.

### Affected APIs
* `M:System.Windows.DataObject.GetData(System.String)`
* `M:System.Windows.DataObject.GetData(System.Type)`
* `M:System.Windows.DataObject.GetData(System.String,System.Boolean)`

    Don't know what data they're getting. Can give an informational diagnostic if we see the GetData APIs called, though.
