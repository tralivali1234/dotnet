## Two-way data-binding to a property with a non-public setter is not supported

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.5.1

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description
Attempting to data bind to a property without a public setter has never been a supported scenario. Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.5.1, this scenario will throw an InvalidOperationException. Note that this new exception will only be thrown for apps that specifically target the .NET Framework 4.5.1. If an app targets the .NET Framework 4.5, the call will be allowed. If the app does not target a particular .NET Framework version, the binding will be treated as one-way.

- [x] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
The app should be updated to either use one-way binding, or expose the property's setter publicly. Alternatively, targeting the .NET Framework 4.5 will cause the app to exhibit the old behavior.

### Affected APIs
* `F:System.Windows.Data.BindingMode.TwoWay`

### Category
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

<!--
    ### Notes
    This is a good candidate for a non-code source analyzer since most cases of two-way binding will be defined in XAML
