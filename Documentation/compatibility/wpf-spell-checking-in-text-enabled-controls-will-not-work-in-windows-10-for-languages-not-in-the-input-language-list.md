## WPF spell checking in text-enabled controls will not work in Windows 10 for languages not in the OS's input language list

### Scope
Edge

### Version Introduced
4.6

### Source Analyzer Status
Not planned

### Change Description
When running on Windows 10, the spell checker may not work for WPF text-enabled controls because platform spell-checking capabilities are available only for languages present in the input languages list. 

In Windows 10, when a language is added to the list of available keyboards, Windows automatically downloads and installs a corresponding Feature on Demand (FOD) package that provides spell-checking capabilities. By adding the language to the input languages list, the spell checker will be supported. 

- [ ] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
Be aware that the language or text to be spell-checked must be added as an input language for spell-checking to work in Windows 10.

### Affected APIs
* Not detectable via API analysis
