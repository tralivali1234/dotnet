## WebUtility.HtmlEncode and WebUtility.HtmlDecode round-trip BMP correctly

### Scope
Edge

### Version Introduced
4.5

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description
For applications that target the .NET Framework 4.5, characters that are outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) round-trip correctly when they are passed to the WebUtility.HtmlDecode method.

- [x] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
This change should have no effect on current applications, but to restore the original behavior, set the targetFramework attribute of the `<httpRuntime>` element to a string other than "4.5". You can also set the `unicodeEncodingConformance` and `unicodeDecodingConformance` attributes of the `<webUtility>` configuration element to control this behavior independently of the targeted version of the .NET Framework.

### Affected APIs
* `M:System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode(System.String)`
* `M:System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode(System.String,System.IO.TextWriter)`

    ### Notes
    This shouldn't affect anything. An analyzer may not add much beyond ApiPort, but we could do basic parameter analysis and potentially implement a code fix
