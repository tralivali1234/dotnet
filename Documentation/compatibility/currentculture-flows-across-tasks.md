## CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture flow across tasks

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.6

### Version Reverted
4.6.2

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description
Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.6, [CurrentCulture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) and [CurrentUICulture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) are stored in the thread's [ExecutionContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.executioncontext%28v=vs.110%29.aspx), which flows across asynchronous operations.

This means that changes to CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture will be reflected in tasks which are later run asynchronously. This is different from the behavior of previous .NET Framework versions (which would reset CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture in all asynchronous tasks).

- [x] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
Apps affected by this change may work around it by explicitly setting the desired CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture as the first operation in an async Task. Alternatively, the old behavior (of not flowing CurrentCulture/CurrentUICulture) may be opted into by setting the following compatibility switch:
```C#
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Globalization.NoAsyncCurrentCulture", true);
```

This issue has been fixed by WPF in .NET Framework 4.6.2. It has also been fixed in .NET Frameworks 4.6, 4.6.1 through [KB 3139549](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3139549). 
Applications targeting .NET 4.6 or later will automatically get the right behavior in WPF applications - CurrentCulture/CurrentUICulture would be preserved across Dispatcher operations. 

### Affected APIs
* `M:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.set_CurrentCulture(System.Globalization.CultureInfo)`
* `M:System.Threading.Thread.set_CurrentCulture(System.Globalization.CultureInfo)`
* `M:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.set_CurrentUICulture(System.Globalization.CultureInfo)`
* `M:System.Threading.Thread.set_CurrentUICulture(System.Globalization.CultureInfo)`
