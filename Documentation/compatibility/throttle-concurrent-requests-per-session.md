## Throttle concurrent requests per session

### Scope
Edge

### Version Introduced
4.7

### Source Analyzer Status
NotPlanned

### Change Description
In the .NET Framework 4.6.2 and earlier, ASP.NET executes requests with the same Sessionid sequentially, and ASP.NET always issues the Sessionid through cookie by default. If a page takes a long time to respond, it will significantly degrade server performance just by pressing F5 on the browser. In the fix, we added a counter to track the queued requests and terminate the requests when they exceed a specified limit. The default value is 50. If the the limit is reached, a warning will be logged in the event log, and an HTTP 500 response may be recorded in the IIS log.

- [x] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
To restore the old behavior, you can add the following setting to your web.config file to opt out of the new behavior.

```xml
  <appSettings>
    <add key="aspnet:RequestQueueLimitPerSession" value="2147483647"/>
  </appSettings>
```
