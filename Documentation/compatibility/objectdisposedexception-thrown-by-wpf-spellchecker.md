### Change Description

WPF applications occasionally crash during application shutdown with an
<xref:System.ObjectDisposedException?displayProperty=name> thrown by the
spellchecker. This is fixed in .NET 4.7 WPF by handling the exception
gracefully, and thus ensuring that applications are no longer adversely
affected. It should be noted that occasional first-chance exceptions would
continue to be observed in applications running under a debugger.
