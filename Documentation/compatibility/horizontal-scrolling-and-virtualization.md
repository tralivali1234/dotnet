## Horizontal scrolling and virtualization

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.6.2

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description
This change applies to an ItemsControl that does its own virtualization in the
direction orthogonal to the main scrolling direction (the chief example is
DataGrid with EnableColumnVirtualization="True").  The outcome of certain 
horizontal scolling operations has been changed to produce results that are more
intuitive and more analogous to the results of comparable vertical operations.

The operations include "Scroll Here" and "Right Edge", to use the names from the menu
obtained by right-clicking a horizontal scrollbar.  Both of these compute a 
candidate offset and call IScrollInfo.SetHorizontalOffset.  After scrolling to the new
offset, the notion of "here" or "right edge" may have changed because newly
de-virtualized content has changed the value of IScrollInfo.ExtentWidth.

Prior to .Net 4.6.2, the scroll operation simply uses the candidate offset, even
though it may not be "here" or at the "right edge" any more.  This results in effects
like "bouncing" the scroll thumb, best illustrated by example.  Suppose a DataGrid has
ExtentWidth=1000 and Width=200.  A scroll to "Right Edge" uses candidate offset 
1000 - 200 = 800.  While scrolling to that offset, new columns are de-virtualized;
let's suppose they are very wide, so that the ExtentWidth changes to 2000.  The scroll
ends with HorizontalOffset=800, and the thumb "bounces" back to near the middle of
the scrollbar - precisely at 800/2000 = 40%.

The change is to recompute a new candidate offset when this situation occurs, and
try again.  (This is how vertical scrolling works already.)

The change produces a more predictable and intuitive experience for the end user,
but it could also affect any app that depends on the exact value of HorizontalOffset
after a horizontal scroll, whether invoked by the end user or by an explicit call
to SetHorizontalOffset.

- [ ] Quirked // Uses some mechanism to turn the feature on or off, usually using runtime targeting, AppContext or config files. Needs to be turned on automatically for some situations.
- [ ] Build-time break // Causes a break if attempted to recompile

### Recommended Action
An app that uses a predicted value for HorizontalOffset should be changed to
fetch the actual value (and the value of ExtentWidth) after any horizontal
scroll that could change ExtentWidth due to de-virtualization.
