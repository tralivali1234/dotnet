## Marshal.SizeOf and Marshal.PtrToStructure overloads break dynamic code

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.5.1

### Source Analyzer Status
Available

### Change Description
Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.5.1, dynamically binding to the methods
<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf``1>,
<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf``1(``0)>,
<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStructure(System.IntPtr,System.Object)>,
<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStructure(System.IntPtr,System.Type)>,
<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStructure``1(System.IntPtr)>,
or
<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.PtrToStructure``1(System.IntPtr,``0)>,
(via Windows PowerShell, IronPython, or the C# dynamic keyword, for example) can
result in `MethodInvocationExceptions` because new overloads of these methods
have been added that may be ambiguous to the scripting engines.

- [ ] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action

Update scripts to clearly indicate which overload should be used. This can
typically done by explicitly casting the methods' type parameters as
<xref:System.Type>. See [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2909958/)
for more detail and examples of how to workaround the issue.

<!--
    ### Notes
    The only case that we can reasonably find with C# analyzers will be the case of dynamic objects being passed to SizeOf
    or PtrToStructure methods without an explicit cast.  Also, note that APIs for ApiPort are not listed to search for
    since the broken cases are so narrow that the rules would likely add more noise than they're worth.
