## CurrentCulture is not preserved across WPF Dispatcher operations

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.6

### Version Reverted
4.6.2

### Source Analyzer Status
Planned

### Change Description

Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.6, changes to
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> or
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name>
made within a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher?displayProperty=name>
will be lost at the end of that dispatcher operation. Similarly, changes to
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> or
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name>
made outside of a Dispatcher operation may not be reflected when that operation
executes.

Practically speaking, this means that
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> and
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name>
changes may not flow between WPF UI callbacks and other code in a WPF
application.

This is due to a change in
<xref:System.Threading.ExecutionContext?displayProperty=name> that causes
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> and
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name> to
be stored in the execution context beginning with apps targeting the .NET
Framework 4.6. WPF dispatcher operations store the execution context used to
begin the operation and restore the previous context when the operation is
completed. Because
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> and
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name>
are now part of that context, changes to them within a dispatcher operation are
not persisted outside of the operation.

- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action

Apps affected by this change may work around it by storing the desired
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> or
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name> in
a field and checking in all Dispatcher operation bodies (including UI event
callback handlers) that the correct
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name> and
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name>
are set. Alternatively, because the ExecutionContext change underlying this WPF
change only affects apps targeting the .NET Framework 4.6 or newer, this break
can be avoided by targeting the .NET Framework 4.5.2.

Apps that target .NET Framework 4.6 or later can also work around this by
setting the following compatibility switch:

    ```
    AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Globalization.NoAsyncCurrentCulture", true);
    ```

This issue has been fixed by WPF in .NET Framework 4.6.2. It has also been fixed
in .NET Frameworks 4.6, 4.6.1 through [KB 3139549](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3139549).
Applications targeting .NET 4.6 or later will automatically
get the right behavior in WPF applications -
<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=name>/<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=name>)
would be preserved across Dispatcher operations.

### Affected APIs
* Not detectable via API analysis

### Category
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

<!--
    ### Notes
    This issue is not marked as detectable via API analysis because simply looking for CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture being set is insufficient in most cases - it must be done in a WPF app.
    Also, looking for WPF Dispatcher invocations is insufficient because many dispatcher invocations are automatic and, besides that, there is no way to know if CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture matters for those dispatchers.
