## A ConcurrentDictionary serialized in .NET 4.5 with NetDataContractSerializer cannot be deserialized by .NET 4.5.1 or 4.5.2

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.5.1

### Version Reverted
4.6

### Source Analyzer Status
Available

### Change Description

Due to internal changes to the type,
<xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary`2> objects that are
serialized with the .NET Framework 4.5 using the
<xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer?displayProperty=name>
cannot be deserialized in the .NET Framework 4.5.1 or in the .NET Framework
4.5.2.

Note that moving in the other direction (serializing with the .NET Framework
4.5.x and deserializing with the .NET Framework 4.5) works. Similarly, all 4.x
cross-version serialization works with the .NET Framework 4.6.

Serializing and deserializing with a single version of the .NET Framework is not
affected.

### Recommended Action
If it is necessary to serialize and deserialize a <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary`2?displayProperty=name> between the .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Framework 4.5.1/4.5.2, an alternate serializer like the
<xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer?displayProperty=name> or <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter?displayProperty=name> serializer should be used instead of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer?displayProperty=name>.

Alternatively, because this issue is addressed in the .NET Framework 4.6, it may be solved by upgrading to that version of the .NET Framework.

<!--
    ### Notes
    Should be fairly easy to detect ConcurrentDictionary objects being serialized/deserialized by a NetDataContractSerializer.
