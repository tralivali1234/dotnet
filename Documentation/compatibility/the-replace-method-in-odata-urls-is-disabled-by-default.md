### Recommended Action
If the replace method is required (which is uncommon), it can be re-enabled through a [config settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.services.configuration.dataservicesfeaturessection.replacefunction.aspx). However, an enabled replace method can open security vulnerabilities and should only be used after careful review.
