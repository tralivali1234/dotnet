## EF no longer throws for QueryViews with specific characteristics

### Scope
Edge

### Version Introduced
4.5.2

### Source Analyzer Status
Not planned

### Change Description
Entity Framework no longer throws a StackOverflowException exception when an app executes a query that involves a QueryView with a 0..1 navigation property that attempts to include the related entities as part of the query. For example, by calling `.Include(e => e.RelatedNavProp)`. 

- [ ] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
This change only affects code that uses QueryViews with 1-0..1 relationships when running queries that call .Include. It improves reliability and should be transparent to almost all apps. However, if it causes unexpected behavior, you can disable it by adding the following entry to the `<appSettings>` section of the app's configuration file: 

```xml
<add key="EntityFramework_SimplifyUserSpecifiedViews" value="false" /> 
```

### Affected APIs
* Not detectable via API analysis

### Category
Entity Framework
